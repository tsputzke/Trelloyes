The Card component should render markup matching the design.html: a div with a class of 'Card' containing an h3 for the card's title and a p element for the card's content.


The Card component accepts 2 props: title and content.


title is a string of the card's title.


content is a string of the card's content.


These props will be passed in for each Card from the List component.
